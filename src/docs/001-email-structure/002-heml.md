title: Heml
---

The `<heml>` element opens every HEML email. Its comparable to the `<html>` tag. Everything in your email must be inside of it.

**Note:** The HEML element handles setting `<!DOCTYPE>` so you should not add that to your email.

### Example
```xml
<heml>
  <!-- your head and body go here -->
</heml>
```
